    <h2>About FaithWorker Ministry</h2>
    <p>The FaithWorker Ministry is a once-monthly service ministry established to render
      physical assistance in the homes of Woodstream Church members who are sick/disabled;
      seniors (65+); widows, and single-parents.</p>
    <p>The purpose is to promote goodwill in our membership through the tangible demonstration
      of our faith to "make increase of the Body unto the edifying of itself in love." (Ephesians 4:16)</p>
    <p>This is a benevolent work carried out by volunteer members who are firmly convinced that "faith
      without works is dead" (James 2:17, 20), and that because of grace, we are "created in Christ Jesus
      unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them." (Ephesians 2:10)</p>
